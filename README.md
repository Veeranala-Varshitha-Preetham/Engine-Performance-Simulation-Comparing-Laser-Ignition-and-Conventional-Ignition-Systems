# Engine-Performance-Simulation-Comparing-Laser-Ignition-and-Conventional-Ignition-Systems
This project compares the performance of Laser Ignition System (LIS) and Conventional Ignition System (CIS) through simulation. The engine is designed in SOLIDWORKS, and performance is modeled in MATLAB/Simulink to analyze combustion efficiency, power output, and emission characteristics.
