## Engine Performance Comparison between Laser and Conventional Ignition Systems

This project compares the performance of a **engine** using a **Laser Ignition System (LIS)** and a **Conventional Ignition System (CIS)** through simulation. The analysis focuses on **combustion efficiency, pressure, temperature, and overall engine performance**.

---

##  Overview
The study explores how replacing the conventional spark ignition with a laser ignition system affects engine behavior.  
**SOLIDWORKS** is used for engine modeling, while **MATLAB/Simulink** is used for performance simulation.  
Results show that laser ignition offers better combustion characteristics, improved efficiency, and lower emissions.

##  Key Points
- Laser ignition provides **faster and more complete combustion**.  
- No electrode erosion or energy loss as in conventional systems.  
- Can ignite **lean air–fuel mixtures**, improving fuel economy.  
- Results show **higher peak pressure and temperature** with LIS.

##  Results Summary
| Parameter | CIS | LIS |
|------------|------|------|
| Peak Pressure (bar) | 47.1 | 100.1 |
| Peak Temperature (K) | 1265 | 2590 |
| Combustion Speed | Moderate | High |
| Emission | Higher | Lower |
